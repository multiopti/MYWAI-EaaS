# Introduction

MYWAI™ EaaS is an IoT platform which has been specifically developed to support manufacturers planning to transition from a traditional product-based to a service-based business model.

It is an open, flexible, modular platform ready to deliver intelligence, wherever it is required, with the final goal of helping manufacturers to meet their customer’s expectations, based on the following principles:

1\) Focus on critical EaaS functions:

* Collect and process data from the equipment, which can be used for: designing future versions, preduct re-design, optimization of operations, triggering service activities, supporting insurance claims, billing, updating a digital twin, etc.
* High-level remote-control functions, related to diagnostics, maintenance, software upgrading, etc.

2\) Flexibility / openness: to easily integrate with other systems, to add new algorithms, run in cloud or edge, etc. Although there are many pre-installed features, the platform can be fully customized.

3\) Security, safety, and reliability: based on distributed ledger technology (DLT).

3\) Full support for clients during their “servitization” journey.

4\) Seamlessly and swift integration through most common IIoT protocols.

5\) Explainability and trustworthiness of all deployed AI intelligence.

The general architecture is depicted in the next figure.
