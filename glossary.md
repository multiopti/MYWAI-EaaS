**Equipment as a Service (EaaS)**: The process in which production systems, machines, or equipment are not sold but instead leased to companies. It goes beyond service contracts, with more effective operations and a financial model based on pay per use/outcome models.

**Industrial IoT platform**: A set of integrated software capabilities spanning efforts to improve asset management decision making as well as operational visibility and control for plants, infrastructure, and equipment within asset-intensive industries. The IIoT platform may be consumed as a technology suite or as an open and general-purpose application platform, or both in combination. The platform is engineered to support the requirements of safety, security and mission criticality associated with industrial assets and their operating environments. The IIoT platform software that resides on devices — such as, controllers, routers, access points, gateways and edge computing systems — is considered part of a distributed IIoT platform. **Source**: Gartner, “Industrial IoT Platforms Reviews 2022” https://www.gartner.com/market/industrial-iot-platforms (accessed Jun. 17, 2022).
